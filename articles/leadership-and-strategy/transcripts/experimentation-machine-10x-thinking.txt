0:00
everyone um good afternoon um thanks for joining
0:06
us for this uh this far side chat with Jeff bosgang um and uh Jeff really
0:15
doesn't need an introduction in the entrepreneurship and Venture Capital ecosystem um but uh let me give you some
0:22
of the highlights of his background and Jeff and I have known each other for H
0:28
more than 30 years and we HPS classmates H we also are study group classmates and
0:35
that's where I learned how many um standard deviations a human being can
0:40
have between the intelligence of another another human being um um we have been
0:47
busy peers for quite a few years h h o
0:53
over 20 years ago Jeff co-founded flybridge and he continues to lead fly
0:58
flybridge which is one of the premier early stage VC funds uh in the US with
1:05
over a billion dollars in assets under management H also H he has written two
1:11
books the three books that he has written is are behind him and mastering the VC game which he wrote in 2010 and
1:20
entering startup land which uh the first one got more praise but I actually
1:26
prefer the entering startup land and I think that's a great book and and we are
1:32
also HBS colleagues and Jeff has been the faculty of har school for over 10
1:38
years where he designed and leads in the second year in HBS MBA course called
1:44
launching tech tech Ventures everybody at HBS calls at LTV which onethird of
1:50
the students at the MBA class takes that course so it's tremendously popular um
1:56
one of the most popular HBS courses so congratulations Jeff on that um now at
2:01
the book launch which happened last Thursday um which Jeff H offered and
2:08
hosted for HBS students and faculty Mitch wise H who interviewed H Jeff for
2:16
the launch said this book is not only about how to become a 10x founder and
2:23
this book is about how to become a 10x leader and and I think it very much
2:29
repres present what this book is about and we're going to get quite a bit on the how um now I would like to add to
2:36
this H quote from from Mitch by saying that this book is an invitation H it's an invitation to
2:44
become an a 10x leader with the help of AI um now J book is also a manual that
2:53
every startup founder should have at their side and I say this regard
2:59
regardless of AI um the book is a man of how to launch and scale your Venture and
3:07
of course in this book Jeff also suggests um how AI can can do it faster
3:16
leaner and better um now the the book is a gem in many ways um but one of the
3:23
reasons why it it's a gem just to give you an example in appendix a he takes
3:30
you step and step step by step on with tips and examples of how you should
3:37
interact with the ey so it really brings it down to to to the very practical
3:43
level in appendix D he lists the apps that He suggests and and tools to
3:51
recommend to start using AI so really very practical book to get you started
3:57
in this journey of of AI and um Now by reading the this book you will not
4:03
become an expert in AI that is not the intention of the book um but it is a
4:08
motivation and a guide so you so you can start your o own H journey to become a
4:14
10x leader and and let me give you a notch of why you should read this book
4:20
and and start this this journey and soon and soon is in months not years um if
4:28
you are not well versed in to ai co-pilots ai agents and it will be
4:34
exactly the same as if today you didn't know how to use Microsoft Excel that's
4:39
basically how I think it should be viewed now the good news is that all
4:45
these tools are not rocket science and and Jeff States in in in his book a PhD
4:53
is no longer needed to build an ai ai forward company the technical playing
4:59
field is being leveled by this technology and so after reading this
5:05
book you I think a lot of that anxiety will come down because you'll see that
5:11
anyone any of us can actually do this um and uh and and I think that's one of the
5:17
great things about this book um now we're gonna um um right now I'm going to
5:24
pass it over to Jeff to give us a little bit of of uh of some of the basics um on
5:32
some of the fundamentals and uh after we're going to have a a conversation and in the last 10
5:40
minutes we're going to leave it for a Q&A which if you have questions please submit them submit them in the in the
5:48
Q&A feature and for Zoom so with this um again thank you very much for joining
5:53
and I'll pass it over to to Jeff thank you so much Alvaro you know you said we've been
6:00
friends for over 30 years which is very true I'm not sure if that happened when we were 5 years old or 25 years old at
6:07
Harvard Business School I think it's uh kind of hard to Fathom but Alvaro has been with me for over three decades and
6:13
we've lived these parallel lives as investors entrepreneurs and faculty
6:19
colleagues here at Harvard Business School and it's been just a joy um to be on that Journey with you and I was so
6:24
grateful you were there last week you got to meet my mom and of course you know my wife and my mom who's 92 years
6:30
old I revealed to the audience is a power user of chat GPT my mom was
6:36
telling a few of my students that she used it to help her write a job description for the coral director at
6:43
her senior care home for the chorus that um that they've created so to your point
6:50
Alvaro don't be scared of AI if my 92-year-old mom can be a power user you all can be power users and of these
6:57
incredible tools as well so I'll maybe show a couple slides and tell a little
7:03
bit the story of the book amplifying what Alvaro said and then I'll open it up for conversation and questions and
7:11
the the book um as as Alvaro described it's really what I hope is a Playbook or
7:17
a framework for how you can become a 10x leader and we all know this mythical 10x
7:23
software developer that's out there that's 10 times more productive than the average software developer and we all
7:28
try to hire those incredible 10x software developers into our portfolio companies and work with them in our in
7:33
our in our lives I believe we're entering an era where as I say at the beginning of the book AI is not going to
7:40
replace Founders anytime soon but Founders who use AI are going to replace
7:46
Founders who don't and the founders who learn to you use AI effectively are going to be effectively 10x Founders
7:53
they're going to be 10 times more productive than the average and typical founder and that's not just relegated to
7:59
Founders it's it's the same for salespeople for analysts for consultants for marketers probably um for for us
8:06
even as parents so I'm really excited to reveal and and bring forward not only
8:13
these timely tools and it is a bit awkward to write a a book about AI when
8:19
things change so rapidly and the tools are so Dynamic and improving so quickly and I'll show you a a little bit of data
8:26
on that so these incredibly time tools with Timeless techniques of finding
8:32
product Market fit and creating enduring value in a profitable sustainable business so that's really the the goal
8:39
and the hope of what the material provides and as Alvaro described you know I I've been an entrepreneur in the
8:45
web 10 era I've been an investor in the cloud era and the mobile era more recently in the crypto web 3 era and the
8:51
and the blockchain I firmly believe that this moment in time is far more
8:57
impactful far more disruptive than any of these other technology waves that this wave is the largest and most
9:04
disruptive for all 8 billion people on this planet and that it's going to happen very very quickly and one chart
9:12
that gives me that confidence or provides me with that data is this chart
9:17
which looks a bit complicated but is very simple in its framework it's a an example of the journey that some of
9:24
these models are on and as they've evolved in the last year or two the x-axis is cost so how expensive are
9:32
these AI models and the tokens and the underlying capabilities and the Y AIS is
9:38
capabilities how skilled are these models and what you see is similar to Mo's law but on steroids these models
9:46
are getting dramatically better in terms of their capabilities which is on a log scale and
9:52
dramatically cheaper in terms of their cost also on a log scale and if you sort
9:58
of look at the top of this chart you see this dotted line what is the capability
10:05
represented by a PhD a human PhD in the field a biologist a chemist a physicist
10:11
a computer scientist and these models which now are providing this Chain of
10:17
Thought analysis and these incredible capabilities for a deep
10:23
research and inference and insight are reaching PhD level capabilities so what
10:29
does that mean it means that these capabilities are coming and are going to
10:35
have a massive impact on our economy there's a recent PWC study that forecasted a$6 trillion impact on our
10:43
economy 7 trillion of which would be through productivity gains nine trillion of which would come from additional
10:50
consumption because of these improved capabilities and if you just want to put
10:55
that number in perspective this is roughly the size of the GDP of China so in terms of the scale that we're talking
11:02
about it's just mindblowing and when you think about historically when new technologies have
11:08
come about whether it was the Advent of the smartphone or cloud or EV electronic
11:15
Vehicles you would see this natural technology life cycle adoption curve where the innovators a few percentage
11:21
points would be the first adopters early adopters early majority and over time it
11:26
would finally Cascade to the late majority and it would take many many years for this cycle I did my first
11:32
internet Commerce transaction in 1994 when Alvaro and I were still at Harvard Business School as students Because the
11:39
Internet had just been released and I was one of the first people to do one of these secure transactions I foolishly
11:46
put in my credit card into a website in 1994 and I bought a mug at a at a Lo at
11:52
a little e-commerce store that had been created and it took decades for that e-commerce capability to become
12:00
universally available through Amazon and Shopify and other platforms well what's
12:06
different about AI is that the adoption curve is absolutely vertical the speed
12:13
of adoption is extraordinary and one of the reasons for that is that the devices
12:18
that are delivering these capabilities are already in your pocket there are 8
12:24
trillion smartphones in the world that are getting more and more AI capab
12:30
there are uh over 2 billion laptops and iPads in the world that are getting more
12:36
and more AI capable there are a billion and a half automobiles in the world that are able to be updated over the air with
12:43
their software capabilities for autonomous driving and other AI capabilities thus all of these
12:51
capabilities that you saw in that chart earlier on this log scale that are dramatically improving they're all
12:57
coming to your home and they're coming to your home and your pocket and your office now there's a new release of
13:05
Alexa some of you may have Amazon smart devices in your home I don't know about
13:10
you I found it very frustrating to talk to Alexa lately because I've been trained on the capabilities of chat GPT
13:16
and they're so much better and Alexa seems very dumb to me right now whereas when it first came out three or four
13:22
years ago it was this incredible smart home device well Alexa plus is coming out in the next few days and the llm
13:29
large language model capabilities are going to be embedded and immediately available to you so this ability for
13:35
this installed base to receive these capabilities is dramatically changing
13:41
the adoption curve and when you look at the big companies that are themselves the purveyors of the AI tools Google and
13:48
Amazon being two obvious examples and you look at how they're using the tools
13:53
themselves how the most sophisticated companies in the world are eating their
13:58
own dog food and pointing internally you see some astounding statistics the CEO
14:04
of Google just announced in their third quarter earnings a few months ago that one out of every four lines of code that
14:11
Google is writing is being constructed by Ai and that's a few months ago if you
14:16
look today I bet it's 30% 35% and in the next couple quarters it'll be above half
14:24
Amazon Andy jasse who's coming to HBS next week and briefing Us in more detail on these matters reported in a public
14:32
blog post that he did that the Amazon platform which they've infused with AI to help them with their SKU analysis and
14:39
updates across all their millions and millions of product lines has saved them
14:45
4,500 developer years in parentheses he says yes that number is crazy but real
14:52
and if you look at Clara a more sophisticated fintech um that's
14:57
leveraging AI tools working very closely with open AI they're very public about the fact that they harmonized their data
15:03
store and eliminated all of their SAS platforms and are using gen capabilities
15:09
to improve their sales and marketing and improve efficiency now 100% year-over-year uh employee growth and
15:16
all this is happening and what I'll describe as the co-pilot phase of the AI
15:22
adoption curve the co-pilot the AI co-pilots are those tools that allow you
15:28
to do do your tasks as humans more efficiently and amplify your direction
15:35
and that's the current state-ofthe-art that's 2025 but as we enter into the back half
15:41
of this year and 2026 and Beyond we're seeing more and more agentic AI
15:47
capabilities be launched and this is a new area that's just coming online it's
15:52
very early in company adoption and human adoption but AI agents
15:59
actually do the tasks for you they take and make decisions so they don't just
16:05
provide better information synthesize documents or provide you with interesting insights based on volumes
16:11
and volumes of textbooks they'll actually make take actions and make decisions for you in the context of a
16:17
set of parameter parameters and goals so my example here would be if you want to go on a vacation you might use chat GPT
16:25
to inform you of the most attractive Caribbean island with the best food and
16:31
the easiest flight times and the best climate but if you used an agentic AI
16:36
platform it would book the reservations for you it would make the restaurant reservations pay for the tickets
16:43
purchase the you know the particular seats that you like best that your family likes best purchase the hotels
16:49
that you like best book The massages for you and all the other amenities and do the whole thing end to end so that's the
16:55
agentic world and it does that over a range of modalities you can imagine what this means because
17:03
previously investors like myself at flybridge and Alo at ignia we would
17:08
invest in software companies that we thought would be very disruptive and the software industry is a multi hundred
17:14
billion dollar industry but if you think about what the agentic AI capabilities
17:19
allow it allows these startups and perhaps some of you to not only go after the software budgets but to go after the
17:26
entire budget the Staffing budget and the human resource budgets and so here in this example one of my colleagues did
17:34
this analysis of software spend in payroll automation across hundreds of vertical Industries and she described
17:41
that yes the software opportunity is 260 billion but if the people were automated
17:49
and the AI agents did the work then it could be a multi-trillion dollar for
17:55
trillion dollar opportunity ahead and this is what we're seeing in startups today everyone this is happening on the
18:02
front lines and it's happening for our portfolio companies it's happening across other parts of the ecosystem in
18:08
startup land and it's certainly happening here at Harvard Business School where the standard startup Paradigm of raise a two or three or four
18:16
million do seed round hire 10 12 14 people and go chase the first product
18:21
release and go chase the first million of ARR of of annual recurring Revenue
18:27
instead entrepreneurs are hiring two or three people one head of engineering and
18:33
a handful of agents to do the code writing one head of sales and a handful of agents to help with sales development
18:39
sales engineering one head of marketing and a handful of AI agents to help with
18:45
copyright design execution of campaigns measuring those campaigns and then
18:50
affecting the implementation of those campaigns and changing the product Sam Alman has this quote which I think is a
18:57
is a really provocative one where he says look in my group of founder friends we have a betting pool when will the
19:04
first solo entrepreneur one person billion doll company be created and I
19:09
don't know if that's going to be 2025 but there will be 100 person billion doll companies created this year
19:16
probably 10 person 20 person billion dollar company created next year in
19:21
2026 and this solo entrepreneur that could be a 2027 maybe 2028 event we're
19:27
not far from that the U one of the partners from andrees has this quote which uh we hear about
19:34
all the time in my partnership as well I've lost count of the number of startups that have gone from0 to 10 million in annual recurring Revenue in
19:41
the last 12 months thanks to AI not by burning cash not by hiring more people
19:47
but by bringing on more agents by automating processes and workflows and being smarter at execution which led to
19:54
this New York Times article just a few days ago on how AI is changing how startup land build startups you may be
20:00
seeing this in your region you may be seeing this in your companies but it is for the companies on The Cutting Edge it
20:06
is incredible to see what they're achieving and yet with this what I tell
20:11
people is take a page from experimental design don't just sort of willy-nilly
20:17
run experiments but be very strategic and intentional and have a scientific approach what experiments do you want to
20:24
run what hypotheses do you want to test those hypotheses should have a huge
20:29
impact on your business model and then collect the data evaluate and learn we
20:34
can run more experiments with AI more efficiently and effectively than ever before but what experiments do you want
20:40
to run and what's the strategy behind those experiments that's inherently human and I have a case study here
20:46
Alvaro I'll skip over it just because I know there's a lot of questions and people here don't don't want to be um
20:52
PowerPoint or slide to death but in our portfolio there's examples of examples of companies that are using AI across
20:59
their goto Market functions across their customer service functions and certainly like Google in their software
21:05
development function to build more applications faster and better these
21:10
future capabilities they are coming and they are coming fast and if we see what
21:17
could be around the corner and this is from a former open AI technologist who wrote this incredible white paper about
21:24
what may lie ahead we may see the bending of the knowledge curve as the AI capabilities themselves are
21:32
able to do research recursively on how to improve themselves in the AI models
21:37
and so we're now at that point where if that PhD capability is in the hands of the AI tools and those tools are pointed
21:44
at computer science and the field of machine learning and AI itself as a
21:49
field you will see a recursive Loop where the AI is improving its own
21:55
capabilities and bending that curve and generating automated research and insights uh you know it's like having
22:00
the smartest human on the planet in your pocket if you can talk to it and it knows all the laws of physics all the
22:07
laws of chemistry all the laws of biology every single Nobel prize winning paper written in every subject and you
22:14
have that on your shoulder in your pocket as an adviser you know there's no telling what can be achieved so the the
22:20
questions I'd leave you with are as follows in the audience if you think about and evaluate your own scale of 1
22:27
to 10 capability an AI native level of proficiency you know where do you stand
22:34
secondly use the AI tools to help tutor you on AI create a custom tutor bot that
22:42
you can to that you can have as your personalized tutor that can speak to you or provide back and forth text that can
22:49
brief you on new developments when you hear about some Chinese open source company called Deep research doing some
22:56
deep seek doing some new crazy crazy thing when anthropic raises an
23:01
incredible amount of money and an incredible valuation has happened and was announced earlier today what does it
23:07
mean what are the implications ask the AI for that and then finally just how do you use the tools and embrace the tools
23:13
to become a a more effective leader in your organization and in your life so
23:19
that's the essence of the book Alvaro I'll I'll stop there um I got a lot more to say but I know we want to talk and
23:25
have some Q&A great and than thank you for that for that intro and Jeff and let's let's
23:32
get into some of the details of of of things that you you mentioned and I'd like to take a step back for a second um
23:40
for anybody that goes through through HBS and it's natural to understand what
23:48
an experiment experimentation machine is and the book is is called the experimentation machine but the audience
23:55
that we have in this in in in this firesight chat that is quite broad So
24:01
for anybody that hasn't really come across this this concept and how could
24:08
you explain to them and you mentioned a little bit but again what is an experimentation machine yeah it's a
24:15
great question and you and I teach this here at Harvard Business School in the last few years we've really been
24:21
hammering this home some of these ideas are rooted in 19th century 18th century
24:28
uh scientific discovery phase where scientists realized that there was a
24:33
whole world of knowledge out there that could be discovered through experiments and defining an experiment a scientific
24:40
experiment having a hypothesis or you know a belief about what might be the
24:45
case a question that you want to answer setting up and designing an experiment to answer that question to test that
24:52
hypothesis and then reading the results and learning from those results and iterating from there and one of the
24:58
things that Eric Reese who wrote The Lean Startup and Steve blank who uh wrote four steps to the Epiphany what
25:05
they did was they brought that notion of the experimentation mindset to the entrepreneurial community and over the
25:11
last 10 or 12 Years everybody in the entrepreneurial Community globally really Embraces that
25:18
orientation where you want to build a minimum viable product or an MVP to test
25:24
your hypothesis about what the customers might like or not like we can theorize it but don't spend two or three years
25:30
building it put it out there in two or three weeks or months and then see how the customers react and then iterate
25:37
from there and it's it's a different mindset because in the early days of a company or in the early days as an
25:43
entrepreneur you want to maximize learning not maximize metrics you're not
25:48
trying to knock the ball out of the park you're trying to set up a situation where you're really trying to maximize
25:54
learning and so the essence of the book is taking that experiment mindset and putting it on steroids
26:01
recognizing that AI allows you to run design and execute more experiments than ever before and now the key when you
26:09
have this in more almost infinite experimentation capacity now the key is using strategic
26:16
reasoning and thinking to sequence those experiments and decide what experiments
26:22
you should run that will reveal the most interesting outcomes that will lead to the most enduring valuable company that
26:28
you can build so that's sort of a a complete summary of the experimentation mindset and how I think about it in the
26:35
context of AI and why I titled the book that way now this again is an invitation
26:41
and you know I love the fact that you bring in a scientific approach towards
26:47
learning which at the end of the day what we want to create a startup or not
26:52
a startup is a learning machine um where you have hypothesis and and you run
26:59
experiments to to to learn from those experiments and eventually prove your
27:04
hypothesis or not right so I think that mindset it's a very interesting mindset
27:09
to have not only for startups again we have a broad audience here but if you can bring that that uh um that
27:17
perspective even to a traditional company I think it can give you a tremendous a tremendous hedge I
27:24
love yeah go ahead I'll give you just an example of that there's a company that
27:29
everybody on this line knows booking.com 100 billion plus market cap leader in
27:35
travel they own kayak and uh all sorts of other interesting Assets in the world
27:40
of of travel and they Pride themselves on running thousands of experiments
27:46
every day when they try different value propositions language imagery
27:54
colors different features of different hotels or different airlines or different experiences that they're
28:00
highlighting and they run these continuously again thousands and thousands per day in order to drive
28:07
greater optimization of their results and it's proven to be wildly successful
28:13
and we backed a entrepreneurial team that came out of booking.com at about two or three years
28:19
ago and we watched them operate and their speed of execution was nothing like we'd ever seen and as we talked to
28:27
them and realized this this approach it's not just a uh you know nice words
28:32
on a page it's a mindset and a religion because you can sit in a room and debate should we go left or should we go right
28:39
and the experimentation mindset is I don't know and I don't really care let's design an experiment Let's test and
28:47
let's look at the data and it'll tell us go left or go right let's stop debating let's just run the experiment read the
28:52
data make a decision and move on and that's what I think is the beauty of of this mindset
28:58
yeah and and I I'll underline exactly what you said which is an experimentation mindset is that the
29:04
fault that theault thinking of you know again let's do an experiment about this
29:11
and in the book you you have a quote which I think it's interesting that says anyone approaching building and running
29:17
a startup as they would a normal business is doomed to fail and I would that what what I think is behind that
29:25
quote is anyone that is that is approaching ing on building a running startup without an experimentation
29:31
mindset and I would make it even further I think for the for for the large
29:37
corporation of today and tomorrow you have to have an experimentation mindset because it's not about who's right it's
29:44
about how to run the experiments so that and the data will tell us what is right
29:49
um now of course um let's get into AI which is you've told us what all this is
29:56
is is about but but tell us how this experimentation machine how this
30:02
experimentation mindset can actually benefit from introducing AI into these
30:09
processes sure so what I see our best Founders doing and we now as a firm only
30:16
invest in AI companies and that's been the case for a number of years and I
30:22
would say at Harvard 90% of the entrepreneurs are AI native today and
30:28
this is the first class this year this moment is the first class I've seen of
30:33
AI native entrepreneurs and what they are doing is using the tools to work through
30:43
every step of the ideation process the customer Discovery process the go to market process and the discovery of a
30:50
profitable business model and you and I know that our colleague Tom Eisenman
30:55
created this diamond Square framework which goes through each of the components of the business model and our
31:02
students and our Founders are applying the AI tools to every single component
31:07
every step of the way they're even doing it before they get started we talk a lot about the zero to one process we have
31:14
many many students and Founders who are going from the negative one to the negative 1 to zero process and applying
31:21
the AI tools they're using it for research for customer Discovery they're
31:26
transcribing their customer interviews and recording them and throwing them into a notebook LM which is a tool that
31:33
Google offers for free that allows you to put a corpus of knowledge and then train chat Bots against that knowledge
31:40
they're they're they're creating personas of their customer using AI so that their team can have 7 by 24
31:48
conversations with their customers and ask questions about their requirements and their needs and test different value
31:53
propositions and different features against each other they're certainly building and talk more I know about
31:59
building with the AI tools like Google and others are and they're even executing amazing goto Market strategies
32:05
to enhance the capacity of their sales team so this process of leveraging the
32:11
modern tools and having these experiments across all elements of the business model is happening
32:17
today yep no I and and um um like you
32:23
I've become a huge fan of the diamond Square created by by by Tom and I love
32:28
how you put it in the book which at the end of the day another way to to to represent the the the Diamond square is
32:36
what every startup needs is build a product acquire customers satisy
32:41
customers and make money so in this in this H framework um where can you give
32:49
us some examples and maybe for example in goto Market in in examples that
32:55
you've seen you talked about what some students are are doing but tell us companies are actually using AI to be H
33:03
much more effective in in in in the in the goto Market which in this is the
33:09
acquired customer part um sure so I'll tell you what some of our portfolio
33:14
companies are doing so many of our companies sales organizations before
33:19
they reach out to a prospect they would do research on that Prospect well if you're reaching out to
33:27
a public company there's quarterly earnings calls there's press releases across the slew of products there's
33:34
competitive analysis there's trade show information there's sponsored content
33:41
there's a whole bunch of content that's out there about these companies and there are tools now that allow you to
33:47
draw from that content to enrich and your data set for
33:53
prospecting help determine and qualify and score your prospects and then brief
34:00
your sales team before they walk into a sales call then there's a set of tools
34:05
that allow you to generate demos and build personalized demos for each
34:11
individual Prospect and so some of our portfolio companies and this company Topline Pro is one of them that I
34:17
mentioned earlier has created thousands of personalized demos with an AI Avatar
34:23
representing a sales representative who speaks directly to the customer shows
34:29
them a product with their content and allows the prospect to get a sense of
34:34
what the quality of the work is going to look like and then all these marketing
34:41
campaigns and customer success and everything else there's a ton of AI tools now available to help automate
34:47
those as well so we're seeing even for mature companies these tools being used
34:52
I have a portfolio company that had 1,500 employees in
34:59
2023 and has 1100 employees today but has grown Revenue 50% and what they've
35:07
effectively done is carved out a lot of their customer service team by
35:14
leveraging AI automation improve the efficiency of their sales team with this AI Automation
35:20
and certainly improve the efficiency of their software development team and improve their feature velocity with all
35:27
of these incredible AI software development and code generation tools so
35:32
it's not only our little startups that are early stage companies doing this as I showed you in the chart the two page
35:37
the the two person thre person five person startup doing more with less it's also the scale companies as you noted
35:45
that have even more at stake if they can Implement these tools effectively yep so I most of the
35:52
audience here in this firesight chat are from from from Emerging Markets so I'm
35:57
I'm sure many of the are are many of them are saying okay this all sounds great if you're a US company or if
36:04
you're a US startup right and and and and you're talking about go to market
36:09
and talking about understanding your your customer better and in in your book for example you you describe how you can
36:18
understand your customer better and and ask yourself questions like what does a
36:24
day-to-day in the customer's life look like and um what tasks do they perform
36:30
and what tools do they use where do they experience the most friction and frustration and those are
36:37
some questions that you ask which is a typical question that you will ask one of these
36:44
llms can you ask these questions if you ask these questions if you're an
36:49
Emerging Markets company are you going to get relevant information do they do they actually also work if you are not
36:56
operating in the US absolutely it's not only a question and
37:01
it's a great question Alo because I know this is the case from our conversations and my colleagues in the in the
37:08
international scene it's not only that the models are trained on specific
37:15
countries and use cases and content they're also multilingual and they're also multifaceted because if there's a
37:22
data set that you feel it's missing then you can add your data set to the model
37:27
model to improve the knowledge base and I gave this example of notebook LM and I
37:32
also could give an example of custom gpts that open AI allow and artifacts from Claude and the anthropic team in
37:41
the case of notebook LM if you have some specific customer data that only you
37:46
know and it's about your customers and the nuance and the earned secrets that you've built out over years and years
37:52
and years you can feed that into the model keep it very secure and proprietary and then derive insights
37:59
from the model and that can all be in Spanish language and you can derive and have conversations in Spanish or
38:06
Portuguese or English or Japanese or whatever language you want so it's a really it's an incredible Global tool
38:13
and that's why I find it so exciting you know if you just if those in the
38:18
audience just for fun just play with the chat GPT voice functionality ask it a
38:24
bunch of questions in whatever language you want ask it to read a bunch of documents and whatever language you want
38:29
and you'll be amazed at its capabilities and I think this is again an invitation which
38:37
is we all just need to start experimenting and interacting with these llms on a day-to-day basis and and and
38:45
and become AI a native because it eventually becomes second nature when just as a thought companion as you ask
38:53
if you get that that that habit I think it's is one of the important things now
38:59
let's let's touch on something else which is you've we've mentioned quite a bit about productivity the example of
39:06
the company that you mentioned that went from 1500 employees to 1100 and there are multiple examples and also in the in
39:13
the presentation that you you gave you talked a lot about productivity which is a huge huge benefit from from using
39:21
these tools but let's let's talk about speed um um in in the book you use the
39:27
term moving faster with AI so tell us why and how do you also obtain not only
39:34
productivity but speed it's a it's a great question because this is not just an efficiency
39:41
play it's a capabilities expansion play as I noted you know there two uh axes to
39:47
the chart and it's also a moment to accelerate your
39:53
execution and I remember in the early days of the internet we used to talk about internet time and we used to joke
40:00
that it was like dog years that every year in the internet in the 1996 9798
40:05
time frame it felt like seven years in uh in in regular years today every month
40:13
in the AI World feels like seven years the speed of execution that we're seeing
40:18
the best companies provide is an indication of the speed that all companies can execute on using these
40:26
tools now humans have to adjust their operating model in order to work with
40:32
the speed because usually the points of friction are are humans you know we're all we're all sort of take our time to
40:40
adjust new ways of doing things we're all very habitual we we all know the habits that's why Excel you mentioned
40:47
Excel earlier in the conversation Excel has reached its 30-year anniversary it's an incredibly popular product we're all
40:54
used to excel we're all used to using things in certain ways we're all used to certain tools and so we've got to adapt
41:01
and we have to build organizations that adapt and execute faster and I think the one of the most important ways to do
41:08
that as you noted earlier is around willingness to experiment and then willingness to make quick decisions to
41:14
scale those experiments if they succeed it's not just about running the experiment off to the side to test a
41:21
hypothesis it's Shifting the organization over to the new way of
41:27
doing things if that hypothesis proves out and that's a change management challenge for leaders uh but that's the
41:34
challenge I think ahead of us in the coming months and years um
41:40
now a lot of people when that when we have a conversations about AI The Human Side comes comes to play right and and
41:49
as one of your Stu students you quoted him in your book says why even have human founder right so so what's what's
41:57
The Human Side on all this I mean uh are we going to get rid of people because these these agents are becoming so smart
42:04
and they're going to make decisions for us and so what's the human element here
42:10
I think the human element is really going to be centered around strategy insights into markets
42:16
leadership is going to matter more and more taste and discernment
42:23
curation will matter more and more and some of the rot tasks can be automated
42:30
away you know there's that that famous sort of analysis of we don't need any
42:35
more Bank clerks anymore or tellers with the Advent of ATMs we are on the verge most likely of
42:43
getting rid of some Taxi Driver functionality with the age of whmo and
42:50
self-driving cars um we've reduced our the amount of people that work in the agriculture
42:56
industry as a result of automation on farms so we're going to see these big
43:02
shifts as a result of automation but I also think new opportunities are going to be created I don't think humans are
43:08
going to go away or need to go away I don't think work's going to go away or jobs are going to go away I think we're all just going to be more efficient
43:15
there's a a famous economist John Maynard KES when he was observing what was happening in the
43:22
industrial revolution in Britain uh he he said look this is so incredible ible
43:27
and we're going to all be so productive my grandchildren are going to work 20 hours a week well I don't know about you
43:33
Alo I don't work 20 hours a week nobody I know Works 20 hours a week um we're all working really hard despite all
43:39
these automation tools that we've benefited from over the last few decades despite the internet and the cloud and
43:44
mobile um I think AI is going to prove to be the same I think we're all just going to be doing more things and being
43:49
more efficient and and and Advent more capabilities and and we as humans are just going to be better and more
43:55
effective at lever these incredible new tools sorry I have to turn on the light
44:02
um so um you you say in your book we're still in the early Innings of the gentic
44:09
Revolution so if this is evolving so
44:14
fast why should I get into it now and not just wait once you know this this is
44:20
a little bit more mature why not why not wait why getting it right now yeah because you're
44:26
competive s are getting into it now and they're learning how to use these tools and as I said at the beginning it's a
44:32
little I'm self-conscious in writing an AI book given how fast it's all moving in five years the tools that I describe
44:39
in the book may may not still be around but the mindset of leveraging and using
44:45
the tools and building that muscle will absolutely still be around so my advice is build the muscle now don't wait it's
44:53
like when a a trainer and you have a conversation and you say hey I'm going
44:58
to run a marathon in a year why do I have to spend all that time in the gym getting ready I'll just train right
45:04
before the marathon that's not how it works you have to build up that muscle build up that capability build up that
45:10
stamina time and time again and be prepared when the uh when the race
45:16
begins to run that race agreed never never too early now
45:23
there are lot of Skeptics about AI for many reasons um um not only people thinking why
45:31
should I get that now which I think your your answer is is is is perfect um what
45:37
do you say to the Skeptics about AI there there's usually two types of
45:44
skeptical points that folks will make one is it's overhyped and it's a lot of Buzz and a
45:51
lot of froth but what's where's the real substance and I can tell you the
45:57
substance is in your phone on your laptop and in your car the AI capabilities are here and they're being
46:03
used now and if you look at the Magnificent Seven the seven most valuable companies in the world uh like
46:11
Google and Amazon and Facebook these are the smartest most sophisticated companies in the world they're growing
46:16
Revenue 20 30% year-over-year keeping headcount flat getting more efficient growing in valuation leveraging their
46:23
Network effects because of AI that's what they're doing so point one it's a bunch of Buzz a
46:30
bunch of hype look at the underlying metrics look at the productivity it's
46:35
real point two is there's a worry that people have that it's going to result in
46:41
Greater inequality a greater gap between the Hales and the Have Nots and that's a class statement and that's also a
46:48
geographical statement Emerging Markets versus uh you know the the sort of the
46:54
US's and the and the other uh develop developed markets and is the US the only
47:00
country maybe China as well that has these capabilities and they're going to exploit these capabilities and I think
47:05
those are all very fair risks I will also say that all the research shows that these capabilities
47:12
are having a massive impact on the bottom of the pyramid and having a massive impact on a broad swath of people and one research study I'll point
47:20
to which you know well from our colleague Professor Ram cunning from Harvard Business School where he looked
47:26
at Kenyan entrepreneurs using gen in their solo entrepreneur small business
47:32
context and they were able to dramatically improve their profitability and dramatically improve their
47:38
performance even as let's say relatively unsophisticated users of this technology
47:45
out in a developing country so the research is pretty clear this technology has an enormous impact on emerging
47:52
markets and on entrepreneurs that maybe leapfrogging some technology waves and getting right to this
47:59
one great so let's it's time for us to get we promise that we will get into Q&A at in the last 10 minutes um so there
48:08
are a few questions one related to opportunities to invest in this sector there's a little bit of the tone of the
48:14
question is have I missed the boat and is it too late to get to to get into
48:20
this um so where are where are some of those opportunities from your um and
48:27
from your perspective so obviously I have a skewed lens as a venture capitalist flybridge we invest in early
48:34
stage AI companies I can tell you we're we've never been more enthusiastic we think
48:40
the current cohort of companies we're investing in are as promising as ever before if you look back on History 12 13
48:47
years ago aen Lee a former Kleiner Perkins and venture capitalist coined this term the Unicorn club and profiled
48:55
the 20 or 30 or so companies that were in the club today the $1 billion unicorn
49:00
Club is numbered in the thousands and thousands and the 10 billion company is
49:06
the new Benchmark the decacorn and the hundred billion doll company the centac corn and we now even have a handful of
49:12
trillion dooll companies which was unimaginable 10 or 20 years ago and so
49:17
the provocative question I would ask is do you think they're going to be fewer hundred billion do companies fewer 10
49:24
billion doll companies created in the next 10 years compared to the last 10 years uh and do you think that the AI
49:31
Revolution is all played out I I don't think so I think we're in the second inning or third inning of this game to
49:37
use a baseball analogy out of nine innings or maybe a better football analogy for you like we're five or 10
49:42
minutes into the into the 90minut term on the pitch but we we got a long long way to go on this and I think a huge
49:48
amount of value is going to be created and as I noted not only disrupting the IT industry but eating into the
49:54
multi-trillion dollar Staffing industry behind it and and there's a there there are a
50:01
couple of questions related to large companies so one related to what are the challenges by large companies when when
50:09
they try to introduce Ai and then there's another question related to if you were a and appointed head of AI at a
50:17
Fortune 500 where where would you start to to start and to bring value let me do
50:25
the ladder and then I'll talk about obstacles so if I were the head of AI of a Fortune 500 I would mandate that all
50:33
of these tools would be available to everyone so the top capabilities from
50:38
the top companies I would release the constraints that many companies are
50:43
putting on their employees which was don't which is to not experiment to
50:48
not uh you know risk proprietary data getting out I would I want more
50:53
experiments I want more initiatives and then I would create um a reward
51:00
system for the most Innovative AI applications running pilots and then a
51:05
pipeline process to take those Pilots into production once they hit certain thresholds or metrics one of the things
51:12
I see we call it pilot hell for our portfolio companies is they get a pilot and they hit the metrics and they go
51:19
back to their Champions and say hey this thing works now what and the Champions say oh we hadn't thought about that we
51:27
don't know what to do we got to spin up new processes and create new committees and figure out how to take this thing
51:33
enterprise-wide I would pre-wire the enterprise-wide Playbook put it on the
51:38
Shelf if the pilot hits the threshold pull down the Playbook and get this thing deployed Enterprise wide so not
51:45
only bigger exper bigger and more experiments but faster enterprise-wide
51:50
deployment and then what are the obstacles I mentioned One Pilot hell and
51:56
this gap between pilots and deployment uh and then the other is training you
52:01
know we we need all of our if you have a 50,000 person company that you're running you need all 50,000 to be AI
52:07
native well how do you train 50,000 people to be AI native what I've seen some of our best big company CEOs do is
52:14
model that behavior themselves is to really show it and and live it and talk
52:20
about it all the time Mark Benny off at Salesforce does this beautifully he runs a software company obviously but he's
52:26
he's an incredible role model in that regard so I think really making sure
52:32
that your entire organization knows that this is a priority and it's not a toy
52:37
it's not a uh you know sort of a fad it's something that we need as a as a fundamental competitive
52:44
Advantage now there's a question for neither you or I are and experts on
52:50
private Equity but there's a question from what I would imagine as a private Equity investor and and he's asking or
52:56
she who how should they if you're a private investor how you should you be
53:02
thinking about this it's a great question one of our LPS is a runs a private Equity Firm and he put together
53:10
and hired an AI expert within the firm to help work through their portfolio many of these firms have portfolio
53:17
support teams and he hired an AI leader on that portfolio support team to sit
53:22
next to the talent leader and the marketing leader and the financing leader and that team is looking at internal
53:31
tools much like I described uh you know we as Venture capitalists are using and I know Alvaro is thinking about these
53:37
tools internally and then also uh working with the portfolio companies but
53:43
the real the really interesting unlock that I'm seeing and we've we've invested in this even from a venture standpoint
53:48
at flybridge is is there a world where you might instead of trying to sell
53:53
software to make services for firms more efficient might you build a Services
54:00
firm that's an AI native Services firm and you're seeing this in legal which we recently are involved with where we
54:07
invested in a law firm that's an AI native law firm and using these AI tools to be more efficient and effective in
54:13
drawing up contracts and doing contract reviews you see it in accounting you see it in other areas uh and finance and
54:21
financial services and Consulting where there are individuals who make $200,000
54:26
a year $300,000 a year who are doing things that are very repeatably
54:32
automated automatable and um and and applying judgment that can be replicated
54:38
with the AI tools so I think that's going to be a really interesting area for both wec's but also for the private
54:43
Equity World yep one one last question which I thought it was interesting is
54:50
um at at the Elementary and high school level how are we preparing the new
54:58
generations for this new world um again not neither you or I are experts on this
55:05
but your thoughts on this would are interesting you know last year at HBS
55:11
our students were told be careful be cautious don't violate any
55:18
rules this year they're being told Embrace extend experiment so there's
55:24
been a massive cultural shift here and I'm seeing that cultural shift in many other schools it's going to take a bit
55:29
longer and I'll just give you one example today uh founder friend of mine
55:35
was telling me about his 14-year-old son who has been using these tools to help
55:40
him in his studies he loaded into notebook LM all of his study guides and
55:45
textbooks and lesson plans and developed and asked it to develop sample tests to
55:52
help him prepare for his midterm exam it then he then took the sample tests and
55:58
it identified for him the areas that he didn't do as well in or was lacking in
56:03
his knowledge and then asked it to tutor him and create podcasts that would provide an audio an audio tutor for
56:12
those areas where he was missing in some of these had these knowledge gaps and It
56:17
sped up his understanding of this field and his Advanced his his studying incredibly rapidly that's I think the
56:24
future of what we're going to see in Elementary School Middle Schools and high schools personalized tutors tools
56:31
that allow for more effective knowledge transfer and coaching um Khan Academy
56:36
has been brilliant in in this area as a leader and if people haven't seen some of the videos that saw KH has created I
56:43
highly recommend them but I think we're going to see a world of everyone on the planet is going to have a private tutor
56:48
and those private tutors are going to know your history know your background be helping you in your Learning Journey
56:54
and really um enabling this opportunity of lifelong learning for all of
56:59
us this is I think a great way to to end this this far CH and and Jeff this is a
57:08
perfect example of an AI native person somebody that is bringing those tools
57:14
into their home into Parenthood there's no nothing more important in life
57:19
nothing more important than your family your kids and actually leveraging those
57:25
those tools for your your children to have a a better education and having that that the facto that habit of saying
57:33
how can I use this tool so that the education of my kids can um can be
57:39
better I think it's a great example and outside of thinking about big companies startups maybe you know one thing to
57:46
think about it is start at your home and Jeff thank you so much I also want to
57:52
thank the HBS club for Mexico to for co-hosting this also the Rock Center for
57:59
for entrepreneurship for co-hosting this and this has been great I've learned a lot and I hope it's been the same for
58:07
for and for everybody that has joined us thank you so much and look forward to seeing you soon thanks Al great to see
58:14
everybody thank you
