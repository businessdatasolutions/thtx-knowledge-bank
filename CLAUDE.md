# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Overview

This is the THTX Knowledge Bank, a repository for storing and organizing articles, research papers, and knowledge resources related to business data solutions and AI.

## Repository Structure

- `articles/` - Collection of articles and research papers in PDF format

## Current State

This is an early-stage repository. Currently contains:
- Article collection starting with AI-related content
- No build tools or development infrastructure yet

## Future Considerations

As this repository grows, consider:
- Adding a proper directory structure for organizing articles by topic/category
- Creating an index or catalog system to track articles
- Adding metadata files (JSON/YAML) to describe article contents
- Implementing search functionality if the collection becomes large
