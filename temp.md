OK, this works great. In my course we work with the CRISP-DM framework. This can be expressed as an expansion of the atomic ontology  elements where "Business Understanding" is the context for the decision-making process. "Data Understanding" and "Data Preparation" relate to the the "Data" element, "Modeling" and "Evaluation" cann be mapped to "Logic", and "Deployment" to "Action". Can you help me create a mapping table that shows the CRISP-DM phases alongside the corresponding atomic ontology elements?
